# StealthApp

This app performs a malicious behavior to leak the IMEI of a device to the out 
of the world via SMS. 
It utilizes functions of 2 benign apps to achieve obtaining IMEI number and 
sending SMS respectively instead of implementing these functions itself. 
In this way, it hides its malicious behaviors.

The required 2 apps are: 
  * com.globalcanofworms.android.simpleweatheralert
  * org.communicorpbulgaria. bgradio respectively.

Permissions of send sms and read phone state are also need to be granted.
